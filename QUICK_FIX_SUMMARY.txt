                         PANEL 1 BLACK SCREEN - QUICK FIX SUMMARY
================================================================================

WHAT WAS WRONG:
  - Graph background was transparent (blended into black panel)
  - Line was thin (3px) and hard to see
  - No grid or visual reference points
  - Container could collapse to zero size

FIXES APPLIED:
  1. Changed graph background from transparent to #0F0F1A (dark blue-gray)
  2. Increased line width from 3px to 6px (2x thicker)
  3. Added subtle grid lines (alpha=0.15)
  4. Set container minimum height to 200px (prevents collapse)
  5. Forced widget visibility and redraw calls
  6. Attached plot to layout properly
  7. Fixed hover text color format (hex to QColor)

STATUS:
  ✅ All 7 fixes applied
  ✅ Code compiles without errors
  ✅ Diagnostic tests pass
  ✅ Data loads correctly
  ✅ Ready to test

FILES CHANGED:
  panels/panel1.py (7 locations, 35 lines)

NEXT STEP:
  Run: python main.py

  You should now see:
  - Dark blue-gray graph area (NOT pure black)
  - Subtle grid lines
  - Thick green/red equity curve
  - Responsive to hover

STILL BLACK?
  - Check: Is window 1100×720+ size? Maximize it.
  - Check: Run with DEBUG_DTC=1 for logs
  - Check: System graphics drivers updated?
  - See FULL_VISUAL_ANALYSIS.txt for troubleshooting
